# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
# 
# I think I did it again
# 
# I made you believe we're more than just friends
# 
# Oh, baby
# 
# It might seem like a crush
# 
# But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
# 
# 'Cause to lose all my senses
# 
# That is just so typically me
# 
# Oh, baby, baby
# 
# [Chorus:]
# 
# Oops!... I did it again
# 
# I played with your heart, got lost in the game
# 
# Oh, baby, baby
# 
# Oops!... You think I'm in love
# 
# That I'm sent from above
# 
# I'm not that innocent
# 
# You see my problem is this
# 
# I'm dreaming away

# "Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this..?"
# 
# "Yeah, yes it is."
# 
# "But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end."
# 
# "Well, baby, I went down and got it for you."
# 
# "Oh, you shouldn't have."
# 
# Oops!... I did it again to your heart
